    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 cups chickpea flour</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>

        <h3>Combine socca ingredients:</h3>
        <p>
          In a medium mixing bowl, combine the chickpea flour, 2 tablespoons of
          olive oil, salt, and water. Whisk thoroughly until a smooth batter is
          formed. If it is thicker than pancake batter, add more water one
          tablesppon at a time, until pancake batter consistency is reached.
          When you pull the whisk out of the batter, it should leave a thick
          ribbon.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Let the batter rest:</h3>
        <p>Let the bater rest for 30 minutes before cooking.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Heat nonstick skillet or cast iron:</h3>
        <p>
          Heat a large nonstick or well-seasoned cast iron pan over medium-high
          heat. Drizzle pan with 1/2 tablesppon of olive oil.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Cook the socca:</h3>
        <p>
          Once hot, using a measuring cup or ladle pour half of the socca batter
          into the pan, while simultaneously turning the pan in a circular
          motion to help the batter spread evenly. Cook socca, until the top
          appears nearly set, about 2 minutes. Similar to pancakes, any bubbles
          that appeared should have set. There will be a visible firming on top
          at the edges, but no char spots on top. Flip socca with a large metal
          spatula and continue to cook, about another minute. It should have
          some brown spots on both sides. Remove from the pan. Add the remaining
          1/2 tablespoon of olive oil to the pan and cook the rest of the socca
          batter.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Serve:</h3>
        <p>
          Socca is ready to serve as soon as it comes out of the pan. Keep it
          whole and top with pizza toppings, slice into triangles and serve with
          dip, or cut in half and fill with sandwich fixings.
