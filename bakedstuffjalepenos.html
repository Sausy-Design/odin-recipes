    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>12 jalapeno peppers</li>
      <li>1/4 cup minced onion</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
      <li>3/4 cup cream cheese</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 ounces jack cheese, cut into 2 1/2-inch long batons</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><h3>Preheat oven to 375°F.</h3></li>
      <li>
        <h3>Prepare the jalapenos for stuffing:</h3>
        You can either slice the jalapeños in half lengthwise or you can slice
        off the top one-third (lengthwise) of each jalapeño to make a boat shape
        out of each pepper. The halved jalapeños will go further (twice as many
        stuffed peppers), but you can put more filling into the boat-shaped
        peppers. Your choice. If you choose to make the boats, you can mince the
        tops and add them to the filling if you want some extra heat, or save
        them for another recipe. In either case, scrape out all the seeds and
        ribs from each jalapeño with a spoon (a grapefruit spoon works great).

        <h3>Mix:</h3>
        Mix together all the filling ingredients except the jack cheese batons.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Stuff the jalapenos:</h3>
        Pack the filling into the peppers and nestle a baton of jack cheese onto
        the filling of each one.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Bake:</h3>
        Arrange the peppers on a foil-lined baking sheet and bake at 375°F for
        20 to 30 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned, and
        the peppers are cooked. Cool for 5 minutes before serving.
